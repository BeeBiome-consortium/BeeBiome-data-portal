## Contents of BeeBiome Data Portal

BeeBiome Data Portal contains metadata of datasets from NCBI having a host which is a species under the NCBI taxonomic level '
[Apoidea](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=34735)'. Only BioSamples linked with at least one SRA experiment are displayed.

Based on this set of metadata, you can find the following pages:

* [Browse page](/beta/browse) where you can see and download all metadata with a basic text-search;
* [Advanced search page](/beta/search) where you can see and download metadata from a request based on a text-based search on each field and combine them using a 'AND' boolean logic.

## Definition of metadata fields
* **BioProject acc.**: Accession from [NCBI BioProject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject) (a collection of biological data related to a single initiative).
* **BioSample acc.**: Accession from [NCBI BioSample](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample) (a database containing descriptions of biological source materials used in experimental assays).
* **SRA experiment entries**: Count of entries from [NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) (a repository of high throughput sequencing data).
* **NCBI Nucleotide entries**: Count of entries from [NCBI Nucleotide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide) (a collection of genome, gene and transcript sequence data).
* **Host**: Scientific name of the natural (as opposed to laboratory) host to the organism from which the sample was obtained.
* **Organism**: Scientific name of the organism that harbours the host.
* **Collection date**: Date on which the sample was collected.
* **Geo. location name**: Geographical origin where the sample was collected.
* **Library source**: Type of source material that is being sequenced.
* **Library layout**: Whether to expect SINGLE or PAIRED end reads.
* **Library strategy**: Sequencing technique intended for the library.
* **Instrument**: Sequencing instrument for library.
* **Center name**: Organization involved into the project.
* **BioSample package acc.**: Accession of a type of sample and specifies the list of attributes by which it should be described ([more details](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/docs/packages/)).
